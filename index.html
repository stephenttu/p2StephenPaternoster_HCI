  <h1>1. Existing Interfaces</h1>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VP49lH8.jpg" alt="img0">
  <p>Pros:</p>
  <p> - Futuristic: The look of the design may immediately attract a user to it, and make them more interested in using it.</p>
  <p> - Uniqueness: This dashboard clearly does not look like any other normal dashboard. If the user wanted something that isn't boring, this is it.</p>
  <p>Cons:</p>
  <p> - Complex: There are many different areas and icons to steal the attention of the user. It may take them a few minutes just looking at the dashboard to feel comfortable driving.</p>
  <p> - Reflective Surfaces: Below the dashboard is a mirror-like surface which creates a reflection of the entire dashboard screen. This seems it may be distracting to the driver.</p>
  <br>

  <p>Pros:</p>
  <p> - Simple: Easy to understand, not many features that may seem useless to some drivers.</p>
  <p> - Uniqueness: Dashboard doesn't look like a normal dashboard. The user may be drawn to this design because of this.
  <p>Cons:</p>
  <p> - Ease of Use: Usually cars will have easy to reach buttons around the stearing wheel, but because of it's design the controls are difficult to reach.

  <p>Pros:</p>
  <p> - Normal: Like any other dashboard, the user will instantly understand every feature and use case of this dashboard if they've used any car before.</p>
  <p> - Easy to use: Since it is easily recognizable they won't need to learn how to use anything.
  <p>Cons:</p>
  <p> - No cons, unless the user is looking specifically for a unique or more complex design.</p>
  <br>

  <p>Pros:</p>
  <p> - Unique: That's for certain. This design looks like no other car dashboard.</p>
  <p>Cons:</p>
  <p> - Difficult to understand: The overall layout of multiple gauges and large switches creates a complicated look that may be difficult for users to adapt to.</p>
  <p> - Where is the horn?: The car horn is an important saftey feature all cars need to have easy access to, and there is no clear indication of said feature.</p>
  <br>

  <p>Pros:</p>
  <p> - Simple: Just like #3, this design is very simple and easy to understand. I personally prefer the Speedometer being the center focus of the layout.</p>
  <p>Cons:</p>
  <p> - Missing feature(s): May be some missing features normally included on a dashboard, like the current shifting position you are in (PRNDL).</p>
  <br>
  
<h1>2. Features, Use Cases, and Mistakes</h1>
  <p>Common Features:</p>
  <p> - Speedometer</p>
  <p> - Tachometer (RPM Meter)</p>
  <p> - Warning Symbols/Indicators</p>
  <p> - Fuel Indicator</p>
  <p> - Engine/Oil Temperature</p>
  <p> - Signal Lights (left/right/emergency)</p>
  <p>Rare Uses:</p>
  <p> - Outside Temperature</p>
  <p> - Door Status Indicator (shows open doors)</p>
  <p> - GPS / Integrated navigation</p>
  <p> - Windshield holographic display (shows speed/navigation on windshield in front of the user's field of view)</p>
  <br>
  <p>User Controls:</p>
  <p> - Ignition Turn-Key</p>
  <p> - Blinker Stalk (to control turning blinders)</p>
  <p> - Windshield Wiper / High-Beam Stalk (to control wipers and headlights)</p>
  <p> - Trip Button (to track milage on trips)</p>
  <p> - Multi-media Display / Navigation Controls (Music/Radio/Navigation)</p>
  <p> - A/C Controls</p>
  <br>
  <p>Common Mistakes:</p>
  <p> - Too Complex: Some designs shown here are too complicated, and will require the user to severely adapt to the varying designs that are unlike a normal car dashboard.</p>
  <p> - "Flashy" Design: The first design example has many reflective surfaces. While these may look appealing at first, the constant lights/sun reflecting will create a distraction.</p>
  <p> - Missing Features: Some designs lack common features needed in a dashboard, like transmission indicator (PRNDL), or easy access to an important saftey feature - the car horn.</p>
  <p> - Easy access to features: When a designs purpose is to look futuristic or retro, they may disregard easy access to useful features and buttons around the steering wheel.</p>
  <br>
  
  <h1>3. Improvements</h1>
  <p> - Simple Design: I made the overall interface recognizable to anyone who has seen or used a car dashboard before. That way the user won't have to heavily adapt before using.</p>
  <p> - Included Most Useful Features: I included useful features such as outside temperature, made the speedometer/tachometer combined in the centermost display since speed is only important in its current state, and left out less useful features like trip button. (Can be in another menu)
  <p> - Left room for in-screen nagivation and multi-media display on left/right side: Giving user the controls they would otherwise have to reach for is important to decrease distractions.</p>
