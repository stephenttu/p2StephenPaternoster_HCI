  <h1>1. Existing Interfaces</h1>

  <p>Pros:</p>
  <p> - Futuristic: The look of the design may immediately attract a user to it, and make them more interested in using it.</p>
  <p> - Uniqueness: This dashboard clearly does not look like any other normal dashboard. If the user wanted something that isn't boring, this is it.</p>
  <p>Cons:</p>
  <p> - Complex: There are many different areas and icons to steal the attention of the user. It may take them a few minutes just looking at the dashboard to feel comfortable driving.</p>
  <p> - Reflective Surfaces: Below the dashboard is a mirror-like surface which creates a reflection of the entire dashboard screen. This seems it may be distracting to the driver.</p>

  <p>Pros:</p>
  <p> - Simple: Easy to understand, not many features that may seem useless to some drivers.</p>
  <p>Cons:</p>

<p>a. Issues with current design: One issue with the current design is that the interface is very plain, and all the buttons look and feel the same. While there is audio feedback when something is pressed, it is a very cheap physical keypad which requires a lot of pressure and no tactile feedback. The design would benefit from providing easily differentiable buttons for the user, as well as using higher quality buttons so that there is more feedback.</p>

<p>Another issue, not shown in the image, is a design error with the alarm that goes off when something is done cooking. If you do not shut off the alarm after the first of four long beeps, then it will continue to output the alarm even after you open the microwave door. This tends to be very annoying for the user, since if they do not press “Stop” before the second beep then it will continue as if the microwave does not know already been opened.</p>
</p>
<h1>2. Common Uses</h1>
<p>a. Common Uses </p>
  <p>i. Simple timer cooking (“Microwave for 55-60 sec.”) </p>
  <p>ii. “+30 sec.” button</p>
 <p> iii. Popcorn button </p>
 <p> iv. Reheat function (Choose item weight, automatic cycle) </p>
<p>  v. Cooking Timer (ex. used for oven baking) </p>
 <p> vi. Defrost (based on weight/time)</p>

<p>b. Rare Uses </p>
  <p>i. Power level (most North American Microwaves are the same, times are universal) </p>
  <p>ii. Beverage (more common to boil water/liquid) iii. Potato (more common in oven)</p>

<p>c. Use Case Explanation This microwave interface design makes it simple to complete all the common uses. The most basic features like simple timer cooking, popcorn, reheat, etc. are easily accessible and quickly discoverable from a new user. Even the rarer use cases are just as straight forward and discoverable, as well as this are not hidden in any sub-menu or special alternate button. d. Discoverability</p>

<p>Since the buttons are quite simple, this microwave does not support the user in how to make it work. I would assume that the microwave did come with a user manual when it was brand new, however for products like this you cannot assume the user will always have access to such documentation. Every feature and use case are described in the interface itself.</p>

<p>e. User Feedback

As stated above, the interface provides audio feedback to the user when buttons are pressed as well as visual feedback in the single display. As well as this, it sounds a timer alarm once the microwave is done cooking.</p>

<p>f. Common Mistakes

One mistake the user could make when interacting with this interface is immediately entering cook time before pressing the “Cook Time” button. This will cause the microwave to start for however many minutes as the first button pressed. For example, if the first button pressed was “2” the microwave will start cooking for 2 minutes. This is one part of the design the user will just have to learn, but other than that the only mistake to be made is accidentally pressing the wrong button.
</p>
  <h1>3. Improvements</h1>
<p>a. Tactile, or more visual feedback i. I suggest this because the feedback provided to the user is not sufficient, the keypad is very cheap and besides audio response there is no way to tell if you pressed the key or not. The keypad will also be lit with LEDs which will not only make it easier to see in dim settings but will also display which key has recently been pressed.</p>

<p>b. Alarm that automatically stops when microwave door has been opened i. Since the current design allows the alarm to keep activating even after the microwave door as opened, I would force the alarm to turn off in the new design. If the alarm were to continue even after the door was open, it would seem like the microwave does not even know when the door opened at all.</p>

<p>c. Make uncommon uses less accessible i. All the less used features will be under a sub-menu to less clutter the common use case area. This will make the interface less complicated to new users, as well as allow for quicker operation most of the time.</p>
